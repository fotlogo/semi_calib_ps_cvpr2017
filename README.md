# semi_calib_ps_cvpr2017

Mostly compiled matlab code for Semi-calibrated Near Field Photometric Stereo. To use with your data and adjust parameters edit the run_demo.m file. 
Full source code will be released eventually after we complete some improvements. For the meantime, you can incorporate the executable in your code.
